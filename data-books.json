Description","content":"Primary Phonics is a systematic, phonics-based early reading program. This series builds essential literacy skills including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension. Primary Phonics is comprised of 5 sets of storybooks, coordinating workbooks, reference books, teacher s manuals, and an audio story CD for students in grades K-2. The extension More Primary Phonics allows for additional practice with two more sets of storybooks and workbook exercises.Primary Phonics also includes a comprehension component called Thinking about Mac and Tab. The comprehension workbooks follow the same phonetic patterns as the coordinating workbooks and storybooks. The 147 wh- 148 question words (who, what, why, etc.) are introduced as sight words, as students independently work through the series. Students learn to sequence, recognize story elements, use context clues, and refer to storybook pages, among other skills. Each workbook corresponds to a set of Primary Phonics storybooks 1-5. Primary Phonics Workbook 1 reviews the 17 consonants covered in the Consonant Book and then introduces short vowels in two- and three-letter words. Using a patterned series of exercises, it also introduces the sight words is, a, the, on, in, yes, no, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and black. Exercises involve simple yes or no questions, coloring, copying words below illustrations, filling in missing words in short sentences, and unscrambling words.Storybooks Set 1 reinforces and provides practice with the skills taught in Workbook 1. More Primary Phonics Workbook M1 and the M1 storybooks provide additional practice with the skills covered in Workbook 1. Publisher: Educators Publishing Service Author: Barbara W.

This series builds essential literacy skills including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension. Primary Phonics is comprised of 5 sets of storybooks, coordinating workbooks, reference books, teacher s manuals, and an audio story CD for students in grades K-2. The extension More Primary Phonics allows for additional practice with two more sets of storybooks and workbook exercises.Primary Phonics also includes a comprehension component called Thinking about Mac and Tab. The comprehension workbooks follow the same phonetic patterns as the coordinating workbooks and storybooks. The 147 wh- 148 question words (who, what, why, etc.) are introduced as sight words, as students independently work through the series. Students learn to sequence, recognize story elements, use context clues, and refer to storybook pages, among other skills.
